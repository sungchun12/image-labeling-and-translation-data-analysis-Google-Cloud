**Vision:** I made this because demystifying programming, machine learning, and every other buzzword under the sun is the name of the game.

Whoever's reading this, I hope you feel more liberated to explore all the cutting edge tech freely available and accessible literally at your fingertips.

**Use Case:** Label images and share end results in both English and foreign language

**Order of Operations:**

Import packages and API in Colaboratory
* Get images from: https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/bigquery-public-data:the_met.images?tab=preview
* Label images
* Translate results into another language(Spanish)
* Export into BigQuery for SQL analysis
* Share end results with someone who speaks another language(most important part!)
